2,fix the second row seat movement to access the third row.,USA
2,fix the second row seat movement to access the third row.,USA
2,the front seat lumbar should be able to go back futher so it doesn't stick out as much.,USA

2,fix the passenger side rear seat folding down.,USA
2,3rd row design is bad. the controls are where a passenger might place their hand while getting into second row seats. it causes 2nd row to collapse trapping my 94 year old mother inside. controls should be placed elsewher. second row should have walk thru bucket seat to get to 3rd row. having to remove cargo mat then collapse 2nd row is a real hassle to access 3rd row. i’m trading this vehicle for a 5 seater instead. 3rd row is very poorly designed,USA
2,"the system inside is way too complicated and inconsistent, also i did not ask for the the 2 screens in the back seat they are a terrible design and make people feel claustrophobic in the back seat as they jut our way too far. i really would like them removed from the seats.",USA

3,"the issue was the main computer of the operating system on day 2 of owning, paretti land rover of new orleans went above and beyond to get warranty work completed in extremely fast time. i am in no way disappointed in either product or dealership as electronic things are not always perfect i would say",USA
3,fix the intermittent key fob,USA
3,key fob works intermittently when try to unlock doors. when i am standing next to driver side door and push the button on door handle to open the lock nothing happens. i have to take key fob out of my bag and hold it right next to door lock for it to work. key fobs are brand new and not a battery issue. it should not be this difficult to unlock the doors. why is this so complicated for a basic task?,USA
3,the key fob doesn't open when you are walking upto the car most times.,USA
3,drivers inside door handle would not operate.@ 800miles total driven...so i was trapped..........we traded for mercedes maybach immediately,USA

3,"the fan setting is not intuitive at all, in fact it is maddening, and the vehicle does not seem to get very cool on hot days.",USA
3,1. update the processor of the system. it lags. should never be slower than an ipad. unacceptable for the price tag of the car. 2. ui design is terrible. adding the climate controls in a lagging system is dangerous and bad user experience.,USA
3,screen automatic dimming does not work at all. i have to adjust manually.,USA
3,"brakes had excessive fade, no worries on my end. i have the tpms warning light come on intermittently we can’t catch and also 3 back up cameras. i cannot say enough how awesome the product is. i have bought 2 range rover’s recently and i have a 3rd one on order. just a few headaches to work out. my dealer is amazing as well!",USA
3,"approach to lock/unlock works very sporadically. car also frequently can't find the key when inside. have gone to service, owned a '23 and '24, they both work this way. poor design. never an issue in prior gen. further compounded by the fact that the handles aren't out, so you keep pressing the button on the door handle since the approach to unlock didn't work and it still doesn't, so then you have to grab the fob.",USA
3,illuminate the interior door lock/unlock,USA
3,horizontal storage on the door,USA

3,rear cargo shelf could be more out of the way when not needed rather than having to remove it all together,USA
4,infotainment screen should be integrated with the dash,USA
4,"the steering assist feature fails in snowy conditions when the forward-facing camera in the center of the front bumper gets covered in snow. while one can stop the vehicle and manually clear the snow, it is inconvenient and possibly dangerous on some roads. further, manually clearing the camera will only provide a few minutes of system usage before it is covered by snow again. a separate issue is that the system doesn't keep the vehicle in the center of its lane. rather, the system allows the vehicle to drift back and forth within the lane correcting the vehicle's position just as it is about to exit a lane marker on either the right or the left. on one occasion, the",USA

4,climate controls should always be available. burying them in the touch screen is not ideal when driving.,USA
4,replace the climate control knobs with buttons,USA
4,the calibration seems to be off. the lane assist continuously moves the steering wheel slightly left then slightly right as if it detects the road markings constantly. even when driving in the middle of a lane. it never stops. so we cannot use this feature.,USA
4,replace the knob / dial with a touch screen,USA
4,add an option to disable the adaptive cruise control,USA
4,"the passenger's side windshield wiper crosses over and stops right in the line of sight of the driver. so when it is raining or snowing, the wiper mark where it stops allows the water to cling to the windshield which makes a diagonal line right across the driver's view.",USA
4,"the entire incontrol system is still slow. while much improved from the 2021 version, it remains slow, particularly when first starting the car. the parking assist system and cameras are constantly catching up!! argh",USA

5,"apple carplay and different phones, keys, working, not working total disaster and so annoying to constantly deal with those issues",USA
5,the placement also makes the iphone hot when charging and outdoor temps are hot. then the phone has to cool down before connecting through apple car play so i can use navigation. i switched to using the usb to lightning plug ins under the drink cup holder and close to the refrigerator to keep my range rover phone.......it stays cooler and charges better than the pad.,USA

5,"adjusting the temperature is difficult and requires eyes off of the road. apparently, there is no memory from the last time the car's climate system was operated -- it has to be readjusted each time the car is started. the vents are poorly located. my climate is usually above 75 degrees f and very humid, so ac is extremely important, and this one is terrible.",USA
